      	<h2 class="text-3xl bg-[#687b05] text-white p-4 font-bold">Chapter 1: First Steps Second Edition</h2>

      	<h3 class="text-2xl mb-4 font-bold mt-16 text-[#677A34]">Why a Second Edition of First Steps?</h3>

      	<p class="text-lg mb-4"><em>First Steps</em> Second Edition is the result of over a decade of reflection by teachers. Since 1990, teachers around the world have used the original <em>First Steps</em> materials to make practical connections between assessment, teaching and learning, and to cater for diverse needs within the classroom. They have strategically drawn upon the <em>First Steps</em> Developmental Continua and Resource Books to map the development of their students, and make informed decisions about appropriate teaching and learning experiences. The work of these many thousands of teachers, along with the valuable stories they have shared, has provided the impetus for ongoing, rigorous reflection and reorientation of the resource.</p>

      	<p class="text-lg mb-4">This second edition builds on the original First Steps resource by drawing upon contemporary research and developments in the field of literacy learning. It makes the links between assessment and teaching clearer and more explicit. This will help teachers to be more strategic about what to teach, how to teach it, when to teach it and, most importantly, why.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4"><em>First Steps</em> Second Edition has a strong focus on supporting teachers and schools as they embrace an outcomes-based approach to teaching. An outcomes-based approach in schools means a shift in emphasis from what is to be taught to what is actually learned by each student. The <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition will help teachers to maintain a focus on students and outcomes when the gravitational pull is sometimes towards covering curriculum content.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl mb-4 font-bold mt-12">So What’s Different?</h4>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Teachers familiar with <em>First Steps</em> will notice some significant changes to the resource.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">Strands:</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The second edition of <em>First Steps</em> is organised around four strands of literacy: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Viewing. All strands are threaded with practical, accessible, classroom-tested teaching procedures and activities.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">In response to the increasing impact of visual images on daily communication and the integration of print, images and symbols in multimedia texts, a Viewing strand has been added. Viewing is defined as the comprehension and composition of visual images, both moving and still, in a variety of media.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Spelling strand in the original First Steps material has been incorporated into the Writing strand to emphasise the relationship between the two.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">Organisation Within the Strands:</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Within the resource each strand is further broken down into smaller categories, referred to throughout the resource as substrands. The strands and substrands reflect the change in how literacy is perceived and defined today. The types of literacy skills, knowledge and understandings needed by students to participate effectively in contemporary society have provided the basis for the overall organisational structure of the resource.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2">The substrands provide a lens through which student performance in all facets of literacy can be monitored and supported cohesively. The substrands, as defined later in this chapter, are:</p>

        <ul class="text-lg mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Use of Texts</li>
          <li>Contextual Understanding</li>
          <li>Conventions</li>
          <li>Processes and Strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">The Linking Assessment, Teaching and Learning Book (LATL)</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">International feedback has contributed to a new, comprehensive, cornerstone book in the Second Edition of <em>First Steps: Linking Assessment, Teaching and Learning</em>. This book provides a means of reflecting on core understandings and beliefs about assessment, teaching and learning that are common to all strands of literacy.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">The Maps of Development</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition Maps of Development (formerly known as the <em>First Steps</em> Developmental Continua) are substantially more comprehensive.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Maps of Development have been reconceptualised with an updated and revised set of indicators. The Maps now allow teachers to take into account their own practical research into particular individuals or groups of students, based on a factor of diversity and observed over time; for example, teachers can now allow for differences in linguistic background.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Suggested teaching emphases are clearly linked to phases of development and target specific areas of strength or need.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">A revised and expanded range of teaching and learning experiences has been created at each phase of development. Combined, these improved features provide teachers with comprehensive support and clear pathways to make informed, strategic decisions about how best to support students’ literacy development.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">The Resource Books</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Resource Books have been updated and expanded. Clear links can now be made between the Map of Development and the Resource Books through common organisational structures. New chapters dedicated to each substrand have been created. These provide concise theory and practical ideas for enhancing teaching and learning in each substrand.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">External PDFs</h5>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4 font-bold mt-16 text-[#677A34]">Overview of First Steps Second Edition</h3>

        <h4 class="text-xl mb-4 font-bold mt-12">The Nature of the Resource</h4>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The great irony of innovation in teaching is that the least tangible elements of the process are the most powerful. Too often it appears that a book or a collection of books is the key to positive change, where in fact the crucial factor is the teacher’s engagement in sustained, practical, owned professional development. The subsequent coaching, feedback, discussion and reflection in a supportive setting are just as critical.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><em>First Steps</em> Second Edition is designed to complement carefully structured professional development processes that promote longterm commitment. Together the professional development and the books provide a strategic, whole-school approach to improving students’ literacy outcomes. It is unlikely that <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition will reach its full potential as a teaching and learning resource without the combination of three important elements:</p>

        <ul class="text-lg mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
          <li>quality professional development</li>
          <li>practical and comprehensive materials</li>
          <li>strategic planning for school implementation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">As a resource, <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition is only one part of an explicit and cohesive approach to improving literacy learning. It can be implemented in the company of other programs, and alongside a variety of resources and personal ideas. In doing so, schools and teachers need to be aware of the impact of competing priorities and how the different resources can work together to achieve common goals.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Given the breadth of literacy, schools and teachers may choose to implement only one strand or limited strands of the resource. Prioritisation makes sense and assists teachers to integrate new practices. Ownership and commitment to the implementation of First Steps is often engendered through the customisation of the professional development of a chosen strand. A selection of additional sessions, beyond the regular course, will be available to meet the needs of teachers in different schools and contexts. Attempting to implement parts of the resource smaller than a strand will generally result in piecemeal, disconnected outcomes.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl mb-4 font-bold mt-12">The Structure of the Resource</h4>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">First Steps Second Edition materials are made up of four interwoven strands of literacy: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Viewing, which symbolise the interrelatedness of literacy learning. All strands are threaded with practical, accessible, classroom-tested teaching procedures and activities.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-base font-bold text-center">Figure 1.2: How substrands of literacy make up a strand, e.g. Reading</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">These strands and substrands reflect the change in how literacy is perceived and defined today. The types of literacy skills and understandings needed by students to participate effectively in contemporary society have provided the impetus for the overall organisational structure of the resource.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">The Linking Assessment, Teaching and Learning Book</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2">Research shows that teachers gradually integrate and adopt innovations based on their established understandings of what works best for students (Breen, 1997). This means that the teaching of literacy is underpinned by some personal, fundamental beliefs about what constitutes effective teaching. Consequently the core of the <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition is the <em>Linking Assessment, Teaching and Learning Book (LATL)</em> which:</p>

        <ul class="text-lg mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
          <li>is an essential element of the professional development course for each strand</li>
          <li>provides an overview of the <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition</li>
          <li>enables teachers to reflect on how the beliefs underpinning the <em>First Steps</em> materials reconcile with their own personal and professional beliefs about teaching</li>
          <li>addresses aspects of assessment, teaching and learning that are generic and therefore applicable to all strands; e.g. data collection</li>
          <li>discusses management aspects such as classroom and school planning, creating a positive classroom environment and communicating with parents.</li>
        </ul> 

        <h4 class="text-xl mb-4 font-bold mt-12">The Structure of the Strands</h4>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Each strand of <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition consists of two books, supported by external PDFs. One is dedicated to assessing the development of students and links developmental phases with appropriate instruction for individuals and groups of students. This book is the Map of Development.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The second book within each strand deals with the theoretical and practical background to different facets of that strand of literacy. This book is the Resource Book.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4"><em>First Steps</em> users will find that the Map of Development helps to assess and plan, while the Resource Book provides supporting detail about the nature of the strategies and activities.</p>

        <h5 class="text-xl mb-4 mt-8 font-bold text-[#767676]">The Maps of Development</h5>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The <em>First Steps</em> Second Edition Maps of Development (formerly known as the <em>First Steps</em> Developmental Continua) validate what teachers know about their students and are organised to help teachers link assessment to teaching. Although literacy in practice is an amalgam of the four strands of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Viewing, individual Maps are necessary to represent the complexity of each strand.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Breaking each strand into substrands provides further opportunity for a more specialised analysis of the strands. These substrands allow teachers to focus on important aspects within each strand of literacy. The organisation of the Maps into the substrands provides a practical framework for looking at assessment, teaching and learning and reflects current beliefs about how literacy is defined.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Maps of Development are based on long-term research and theory and suggest the broad phases of development through which a learner passes in becoming a competent user of that strand (Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, or Viewing). Each of the Maps contain behaviours, suggested teaching emphases and a range of teaching and learning experiences at each phase of development. Together these features help teachers make informed, strategic decisions about how to support students’ literacy development.</p>

        <h6 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-8 font-bold">Phases</h6>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Maps make explicit some of the indicators, or descriptors of behaviour, that help identify how students are comprehending and composing meaning. The indicators were drawn from research into the development of literacy in predominantly English-speaking students but many have been found to be applicable to students learning English as an additional language. They are essentially a ‘what to look for’, enabling teachers to be focused in their data collection, management and interpretation. It was found that indicators tend to cluster together; that is, if students exhibit one behaviour, they tend to exhibit several other related behaviours. Each cluster of indicators is called a ‘phase’. This clustering of indicators into phases does not demonstrate that language develops in a linear sequence but does enable teachers to map student progress.</p>

        <h6 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-8 font-bold">Key Indicators</h6>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Key Indicators describe behaviours that are typical of a phase and are used collectively to identify a student’s phase of development, so that links can be made to appropriate teaching and learning experiences. Additional indicators describe or illustrate development within a phase or movement toward the next phase. Individual students may exhibit a range of indicators from various phases at any one time. Students rarely progress in a neat and wellsequenced manner; instead they may remain in one phase for some length of time and move rapidly through other phases. Similarly they may show marked progress in one substrand but not in another. There are many factors that influence the rate and nature of a student’s development, including sociocultural context, cognitive ability and the teaching and learning experiences offered to them.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2">The indicators within each Map of Development are organised under the following substrand headings:</p>

        <ul class="text-lg mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Use of Texts</li>
          <li>Contextual Understanding</li>
          <li>Conventions</li>
          <li>Processes and Strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-8 font-bold">Major Teaching Emphases</h6>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2">Major Teaching Emphases are also included at each phase of development. These are suggestions of appropriate teaching priorities for each phase and are organised under the headings:</p>

        <ul class="text-lg mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Environment and Attitude</li>
          <li>Use of Texts</li>
          <li>Contextual Understanding</li>
          <li>Conventions</li>
          <li>Processes and Strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-8 font-bold">Teaching and Learning Experiences</h6>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Teaching and Learning Experiences are provided in each phase. These suggest different ways in which Major Teaching Emphases may be addressed and offer examples of activities designed to support students’ development within the four substrand areas of literacy.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Figure 1.3 illustrates the relationships between Indicators, Major Teaching Emphases and Teaching and Learning Experiences documented in the Maps of Development. Once the indicators have been used to identify the student’s phase of development, the combined selection of Major Teaching Emphases and Teaching and Learning Experiences, within the identified phase, will support further development.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-base font-bold text-center">Figure 1.3: Relationships between Indicators, Major Teaching Emphases, and Teaching and Learning Experiences</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h6 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-8 font-bold">The Resource Books</h6>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Each Resource Book explains the theory and critical features that underpin the strand within chapters dedicated to each substrand. The learning experiences of the Processes and Strategies substrand are also included in the Resource Books because these experiences can apply to students at all phases. The books also explore how to help students compose and comprehend spoken, written and visual texts for different purposes by providing an explanation of the structure and characteristics of a wide range of text forms.</p>
