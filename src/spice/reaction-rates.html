  <p class="text-lg mt-4">For a chemical reaction to occur, particles must come together with sufficient energy. Particles with only a little energy cannot overcome barriers to combining. These barriers may include breaking existing bonds or overcoming repulsion between particles.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mt-4">In some chemical reactions, particles come together in the correct orientation before they react. If orientation is important, then fewer collisions will be successful and the reaction will proceed at a slower rate.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mt-4">Magnesium ribbon has to be heated with a blowtorch before it will burn. Heat from the blowtorch increases the energy of magnesium and oxygen atoms. Once they have enough energy, magnesium and oxygen atoms react.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-center font-bold">2Mg + O<sup>2</sup> = 2MgO</p>

  <p class="text-lg mt-4">This reaction releases energy. Part of this energy increases the energy of the surrounding magnesium and oxygen atoms to the point where they also start to react. This keeps the magnesium ribbon burning.</p>
